test_essay = """The sun dips below the horizon, casting a warm glow on the ancient temple complex of Angkor Wat. As the last rays of light illuminate the intricate carvings and majestic spires, I am filled with a sense of awe and wonder. 
This magnificent monument, nestled amidst the lush Cambodian jungle, has been a source of fascination and inspiration for centuries.  

Angkor Wat, a testament to the grandeur of the Khmer Empire, is more than just a collection of stones and mortar. It is a living testament to the ingenuity and artistry of a bygone era. The temple's towering central tower, a symbol of the Hindu god Vishnu, rises majestically above the surrounding landscape, a reminder of the power and devotion of the Khmer people.

Beyond its architectural splendor, Angkor Wat is a place of profound spiritual significance. Its intricate bas-reliefs depict scenes from Hindu mythology, telling stories of gods, demons, and heroes. These carvings, meticulously carved into the temple walls, offer a glimpse into the religious beliefs and cultural practices of the Khmer people.  

As I wander through the temple complex, I am struck by the tranquility and serenity of the place. The air is filled with the sounds of nature â€“ the rustling of leaves, the chirping of birds, and the gentle hum of insects. This peaceful atmosphere provides a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of modern life, offering a much-needed respite from the stresses and strains of everyday existence.

Angkor Wat is not just a place; it is an experience. It is a journey through time, a glimpse into the past, and a reminder of the enduring power of human creativity and spirituality. It is a place that inspires and uplifts, a place that leaves a lasting impression on the soul."""
