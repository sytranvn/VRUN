<div><b>PASSAGE 1 - Questions 1-10</b><br><i>Have you ever wanted to quit your job and do something of your own, but never got around because “what if…”? Here are the four heroes in India who actually did it. </i><br><br><b>Abhishek</b><br>Even though he was performing well working for a big company, Abhishek had the strong feelings of uncertainty and dissatisfaction with his job. He realised that sports events and endurance activities were something he enjoyed since his school days. Although it was a tough decision to leave a well-paying and secure job, Abhishek decided it was passion before profession. He quit the job in 2014 to take up long distance running more seriously. He is training for Ironman, one of the most gruelling sports events on earth, and will be representing India in Mallorca, Spain.<br><br><b>Priti</b><br>Priti worked as a copywriter.  However, nature had always been a big part of her life. During her last job as a content writer in Mumbai, she happened to meet GreenSouls – a small group experimenting with organic farming in cramped urban spaces, and realized it was something that spoke to her. She quit her job and started to visit and volunteer at their farms often. Today, the group has four farms in the city that feed destitute children who are also cancer patients. “When I’m on the farm, I’m not just at work, I’m in school, at a party and at work!” she says.<br><br><b>Divya</b><br>Back in college, Divya used to write poems and had published a few on Facebook, which won praise from many Facebook readers. In the real world, Divya worked in a digital agency and in social media. After a few months though, Divya knew that this was not worth the stress and the routine and the job barely left her with any time to focus on her passion. She subsequently decided to quit to focus full time on writing. “No matter how clumsy I am otherwise, my parents love the fact that I am following my passion. To see them happy obviously makes me happy!” she says.<br><br><b>Gloria</b><br>Gloria joined Google immediately after graduation, and lived a comfortable life with perks and international trips. In 2006, Gloria and a few friends went to a child shelter in Cochin. This visit gave them an insight into the poor education provided to street children and children from orphanages. They decided to take matters into their own hands and started an organization called Make-A-Difference (MAD) to educate a larger group of children. Gloria quit her job to <b>further</b> the charity’s aims full time.  Currently with 23 chapters, MAD teaches across 85 shelter homes and over 4,500 street children with the help of 2,300 teacher volunteers all over India.</div>
