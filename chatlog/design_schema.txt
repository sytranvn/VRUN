Here is a design for a database that would support an application for testing user English listening, reading, writing, and speaking skills:

**Table: User**

* `id`: primary key (unique identifier)
* `username`: unique username of the user
* `password`: password for the user
* `email`: email address of the user
* `first_name`: first name of the user
* `last_name`: last name of the user
* `created_at`: date and time when the account was created
* `updated_at`: date and time when the account was updated

**Table: Exam**

* `id`: primary key (unique identifier)
* `user_id`: foreign key referencing the `id` column of the `User` table
* `type`: type of exam (e.g. listening, reading, writing, speaking)
* `question_count`: number of questions in the exam
* `created_at`: date and time when the exam was created
* `updated_at`: date and time when the exam was updated

**Table: Question**

* `id`: primary key (unique identifier)
* `exam_id`: foreign key referencing the `id` column of the `Exam` table
* `type`: type of question (e.g. multiple choice, true/false)
* `question`: actual text of the question
* `answer`: correct answer to the question
* `created_at`: date and time when the question was created
* `updated_at`: date and time when the question was updated

**Table: UserExam**

* `id`: primary key (unique identifier)
* `user_id`: foreign key referencing the `id` column of the `User` table
* `exam_id`: foreign key referencing the `id` column of the `Exam` table
* `score`: score obtained by the user on the exam
* `created_at`: date and time when the exam was completed
* `updated_at`: date and time when the exam was updated

**Table: Examiner**

* `id`: primary key (unique identifier)
* `name`: name of the examiner
* `password`: password for the examiner
* `email`: email address of the examiner
* `created_at`: date and time when the account was created
* `updated_at`: date and time when the account was updated

**Table: ExaminerExam**

* `id`: primary key (unique identifier)
* `examiner_id`: foreign key referencing the `id` column of the `Examiner` table
* `exam_id`: foreign key referencing the `id` column of the `Exam` table
* `score`: score obtained by the examiner on the exam
* `created_at`: date and time when the exam was graded
* `updated_at`: date and time when the exam was updated

This design includes tables for users, exams, questions, user-exam relationships, examiners, and examiner-exam relationships. The database uses foreign keys to ensure data consistency and integrity.

Here's a revised design for the same application, with Examiner as a specialized user role:

**Table: User**

* `id`: primary key (unique identifier)
* `username`: unique username of the user
* `password`: password for the user
* `email`: email address of the user
* `first_name`: first name of the user
* `last_name`: last name of the user
* `role`: role of the user (e.g. student, examiner)
* `created_at`: date and time when the account was created
* `updated_at`: date and time when the account was updated

**Table: Exam**

* `id`: primary key (unique identifier)
* `user_id`: foreign key referencing the `id` column of the `User` table
* `type`: type of exam (e.g. listening, reading, writing, speaking)
* `question_count`: number of questions in the exam
* `created_at`: date and time when the exam was created
* `updated_at`: date and time when the exam was updated

**Table: Question**

* `id`: primary key (unique identifier)
* `exam_id`: foreign key referencing the `id` column of the `Exam` table
* `type`: type of question (e.g. multiple choice, true/false)
* `question`: actual text of the question
* `answer`: correct answer to the question
* `created_at`: date and time when the question was created
* `updated_at`: date and time when the question was updated

**Table: UserExam**

* `id`: primary key (unique identifier)
* `user_id`: foreign key referencing the `id` column of the `User` table
* `exam_id`: foreign key referencing the `id` column of the `Exam` table
* `score`: score obtained by the user on the exam
* `created_at`: date and time when the exam was completed
* `updated_at`: date and time when the exam was updated

**Table: Examiner**

* `id`: primary key (unique identifier)
* `user_id`: foreign key referencing the `id` column of the `User` table
* `role`: role of the user (e.g. student, examiner)
* `created_at`: date and time when the account was created
* `updated_at`: date and time when the account was updated

**Table: ExaminerExam**

* `id`: primary key (unique identifier)
* `examiner_id`: foreign key referencing the `id` column of the `Examiner` table
* `exam_id`: foreign key referencing the `id` column of the `Exam` table
* `score`: score obtained by the examiner on the exam
* `created_at`: date and time when the exam was graded
* `updated_at`: date and time when the exam was updated

This revised design includes a new table for Examiner, which is a specialized user role with its own set of attributes. The `role` column in the User table indicates whether a user is a student or an examiner. This allows you to enforce access control and ensure that only examiners can grade exams.

Here's the design for the same application in FastAPI SQLModel:
```python
from fastapi_sqlmodel import SQLModel
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    username: str
    password: str
    email: str
    first_name: str
    last_name: str
    role: str = "student"

class Exam(BaseModel):
    id: int
    user_id: int
    type: str
    question_count: int
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime

class Question(BaseModel):
    id: int
    exam_id: int
    type: str
    question: str
    answer: str
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime

class UserExam(BaseModel):
    id: int
    user_id: int
    exam_id: int
    score: int
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime

class Examiner(User):
    role: str = "examiner"

class ExaminerExam(BaseModel):
    id: int
    examiner_id: int
    exam_id: int
    score: int
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
```
In this design, we define the tables as Python classes that inherit from FastAPI's `BaseModel`. The `User` class defines the attributes of a user, including their unique identifier, username, password, email address, first name, last name, and role (which is either "student" or "examiner").

The `Exam` class defines the attributes of an exam, including its unique identifier, type (e.g. listening, reading, writing, speaking), number of questions, creation date, and update date.

The `Question` class defines the attributes of a question, including its unique identifier, type (e.g. multiple choice, true/false), text of the question, correct answer, and creation and update dates.

The `UserExam` class defines the attributes of a user's exam, including their unique identifier, user ID, exam ID, score, and creation and update dates.

The `Examiner` class is a subclass of `User`, and it defines the additional attribute "role" as "examiner". This allows us to enforce access control and ensure that only examiners can grade exams.

Finally, the `ExaminerExam` class defines the attributes of an examiner's exam, including their unique identifier, examiner ID, exam ID, score, creation date, and update date.
